gorillaroid

This is a game about shooting things in space on a 2d plane. Think
Asteroids, but with a plot.

Development
===========

To add a new level / state.  Add it to app/scripts/main.js
To default load that level after preload instead of the main screen,
set developingState to the string you stored that state in in main.js

TRY not to commit anything that set DevelopingState.
